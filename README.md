# gussian_machine_learning

The project uses supercomputer to access through big data ( only in regards to volume) that was produced from climate modelling in National Center for Atmospheric Research. The model was used in IPCC for the climate prediction.

As a part of this project, I did a machine learning approach to make the visualization of the output easier to navigate. I plotted a trend line for every single variable which was estimated by gaussian regression method. Then, I used FAST sensitivity index to measure which of the variables used had the most highest influence.
